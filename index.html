      Wild animals are animals that live in natural environments such as
      forests, jungles, and savannas. They find their own food, water, and
      shelter, and are not tamed or kept as pets. Examples of wild animals
      include lions, elephants, deer, and eagles. Wild animals play important
      roles in maintaining the balance of nature.

      Domestic animals are animals that have been tamed and bred by humans for
      companionship, work, or food. They live in close association with humans
      and rely on them for care and sustenance. Examples of domestic animals
      include dogs, cats, cows, and chickens. Domestic animals have been
      selectively bred over generations to enhance specific traits that are
      beneficial to humans.

    <p>
      The main difference between wild and domestic animals is their
      relationship with humans. Wild animals are independent and live in their
      natural habitats, while domestic animals are dependent on humans for
      survival and have adapted to living in human environments. This
      domestication process has led to significant changes in their behavior,
      physical characteristics, and reproductive patterns.
